# Python - Lines + JSON implementation

Usage:

```sh
./parse-kata.jl ../../samples/10mb-input.txt ../../data/python-10mb-output.txt
```
# Before running you will need to add the JSON package to Julia

## The JSON and ArgParse package are not included in Julia's standard library, so you need to add them as a dependency in order to use them. To install the JSON package, you can use the Julia package manager (accessed by pressing the ] key in the Julia REPL) or add it to your Project.toml file manually.

Here's how you can install the JSON package using the package manager:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
1. Run the following command to start the Julia REPL: **julia**
1. Press the ] key to enter the package manager mode.
1. Run the following command in the package manager to add the JSON package: **add JSON**
1. Run the following command in the package manager to add the JSON package: **add ArgParse**
1. Exit the package manager by pressing the backspace or Ctrl + C keys.
